# Group-2-mlops-classification
Group 2: Project for 02476 Machine Learning Operations (DTU Course)

This project aims to classify images of various PC parts using a deep learning model, specifically leveraging the power of Albumentations for data augmentation to improve model robustness. The dataset used for this project is the PC Parts Images Dataset from Kaggle, which contains images of different computer components (e.g., motherboards, RAM, graphics cards, etc.).

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an image classification model that can recognize different PC parts using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We apply Albumentations, an image augmentation library, to artificially increase the size and variability of the dataset, which helps improve model performance by providing a more diverse set of training examples. This ensures better generalization for real-world application, such as automatic identification of PC components in various scenarios.
